# ROBOT CLAIRE
This project is result of three years of development from my high school era ...
The main goal was to build my own robot from scratch without using common
construction parts, which can be bought nowadays in a many shops with things
for hobbyists.

In that time when I was creating my robot wasn't the opensource CAD programs
on the sufficient level to design something which could be then sent to a
factory for fabrication. For this reason the mechanical construction was 
designed in inventor 2013. I case of electronic design I used Kicad.
Project has already three upgrades, but first of them wasn't documented. Still
I took some photos to catch the atmosphere of the very first steps in development 
([claire-rev0](docs/klara01.png)).

## NAVIGATION IN PROJECT
In next folders are placed README.md files as well with more precise content 
description. In particular folders, there is also additional description
included eventuelly with installation and execution as it is a directory with 
software. Currently is this repository in creation process so not all folders
have been fully uploaded yet.
